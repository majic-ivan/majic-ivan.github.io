            <p>General tips. Montenegro gets really busy during the months of July and August. Going in June and September you can avoid the crowds and the weather is still great. </p>
            <p>Montenegro is a small country, so you can easily travel from one place to another. The roads are generally good, but be careful of the mountain roads.</p>
            <p>Public transport is available, but renting a car is the best way to explore the country. </p>
            <p>Be sure to try the local cuisine, especially the seafood and traditional dishes. Montenegro shares many of its staples with its neighbours but of course, we do it best.</p>
            <p>If you eat meat, you are in for a treat. However, if you do not, there are still plenty of options. </p>    
            <p>Montenegro is a great place for outdoor activities. You can go hiking, biking, or even paragliding. The national parks are beautiful and worth a visit.</p>
            <p>The seaside towns of Budva, Bar, Kotor, Tivat and Ulcinj get really busy during the peak tourist season. Consider going inland to explore the national parks and escape the heat.</p>
            <p>The drives along the coast frequently take 2-3 times longer during summer than they do off-season. Plan accordingly.</p>
            <p>Places of Interest: Durmitor, Kotor, Skadarsko jezero, Budva, Ulcinj</p>
